         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FYRST, Wheras I ſpekyng in my booke of Traditions, of the autorite of Byſſhoppes in makyng lawes and ordenances, whyche the people ought to obey, I dyd ſay &amp; teache in this wyſe: That men ought to obey the Byſſhoppes com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundement in all thynges leaful, vpon payne of euerlaſtyng damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon. And that theſe wordes of Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thew: Doo as they byd you, but not as they doo, be vnderſtand not only of thinges conteined in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, but alſo of the Churches or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces beſydes Scripture made by the Miniſters of the Churche, although the ſaid Miniſters do ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe their auctorite for their owne be nefite and profite. And further, where I taught that it is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient that the people obey their Biſſhops co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes &amp; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees although it be but in a thinge
<pb facs="tcp:5269:5"/> indifferent of it ſelfe and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by God, then that ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ſhuld obey their maiſters, or chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren their fathers and mothers.</p>
            <p>And finally, where I ſayd concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng the ſame matter: That as ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iectes be bounde to obey and fulfyll their Princes Lawes, which ar not conteyned in Gods Lawes beyng not agaynſt it, euen ſo be Chriſten people bounde too obey &amp; doo that which their Biſſhops byddeth them doo. All theſe ſayinges I doo now Reuoke, Diſanull and Condempne as erronious and falſe. And do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and acknowledge fyrſt that the auctorite aſwell of the Byſſhop of Rome, whoſe auctorite is iuſtly and lawfully abolyſhed in this Realme as of other Biſſhops &amp; other called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſters of the church, conſiſteth in the diſpenſacion and miniſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods woorde, &amp; not in makyng
<pb facs="tcp:5269:6"/> Lawes, Ordinaunces and Decrees ouer the people beſyde Gods word without the conſent and auctoritie of the Prince and people.</p>
            <p>¶ Secondly, I ſay &amp; affirme that no Byſſhop nor none of the Clergy aſſembled togither haue auctoritie to make any Lawes or Decrees beſydes Gods Law ouer the people without the conſent of the Princes and the people: and if they do make anye ſuche, no man is bounde to obey theym.</p>
            <p>¶ Thirdly, I ſay that in thoſe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tryes, where by the auctorite of the Prince they haue made any ſuche Lawes, thauctorite of thoſe Lawes, doth not appende and hang of the Biſſhops and the Clergy, but of the princes &amp; cheif heds in euery cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try</p>
            <p>¶ Fourthly, I ſay &amp; affirme that within this Realme of England &amp; other the kinges Dominions, there
<pb facs="tcp:5269:6"/> is no Law, Decree, Ordinaunce or Conſtitution eccleſiaſticall in force and auaileable by any mans aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but only by the Kynges maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyes auctority or of his Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
            <p>And where in any foreſaid booke of Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, I ſayd that Tenthes of Benefices be dew only to theym that do preche and teche the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and alſo that he that ſerueth not he Aulter nor precheth not the Goſpell can nott iuſtly lyue by the Tenthes, but is in conſcience bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to reſtore the profites and frutes taken therby: Which my ſayenges as it lieth in woordes &amp; ſentences is ſeditious and ſclaunderous to the Kynges maieſties procedinges and the Lawes and Ordres of this Realme, which haue graunted Ten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thes and Tythes to many Ley per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones: Therfore this my ſayeng as it may be taken, &amp; iuſtly by the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
<pb facs="tcp:5269:7"/> and ſentences as they be put, I wyl not nor entend to defende nor aueere the ſame: but I requyre that I may put theym and declare theim gently, that I ment not in theſe my ſayinges of any Lay men, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of the Lawes and Statu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes of this Realme: but I ment only of Curates and Preeſtes which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing their Tythes, do not their dutyes accordingly.</p>
            <p>And where alſo in my ſayd booke of Traditions, and lykewyſe in my boke of the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, I folowyng Damaſcene and other Auncient Authors, wrote, that the Diſciples of Chriſt dyd make cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Canons, which ſaint Clement dyd gether togither and put in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng, and that theſe ſame Canons muſt be taken for the Appoſtles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and techyng, and their woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des without doubt to be beleued &amp; kepte as that which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely
<pb facs="tcp:5269:7"/> in ſcripture. Now hauynge red many thynges, whiche at that tyme I had not diligently marked &amp; wayed: I doo thinke, affirme, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that doctrine to be not trew, but a vayne, vnlawfull, vniuſt, and vnportable burdein to Chriſten con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſciences: And that thoſe Canons pretended to be of thappoſtles ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and gatherd of ſaint Clement, not to be made of thappoſtles: or if they were, not to be made otherwiſe than but for an order in the Church for that tyme, not euer for to endure wherof many at this tyme in no wyſe be too be obſerued: And thoſe which do remayne, not to be of that force as Gods lawe to charge mens conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces otherwiſe, then as mans Ordinaunces and Policie whiche may be taken away by Superior powers aſwel &amp; with ſo lytle ſcruple of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience as other of them which
<pb facs="tcp:5269:8"/> many yeres a go were taken away, &amp; to ſum clene contrary lawes made</p>
            <p>In the ſaid boke of Traditions alſo I ſayd &amp; affirmed, that Chriſt and his Appoſtles taught and lefte to the church many thingꝭ without writyng which we muſt both beleue ſtedfaſtly &amp; alſo fulfyll obediently vnder payne of dampnation euer to endure. Amongeſt the which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſed by name a greate nomber to be obeyed, kepte &amp; folowed: as the obſeruation of Lent from fleſh or wyne, the kepyng of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the Pyx, the receyuing of it at the preeſtes handes, the hallowyng of the water in the Font, the thriſe dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng of the Chylde in the water at the Chriſtenyng, the puttyng on of the Chriſome, the Conſecration of the Oyle, &amp; Anoyntyng of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened chylde, the hallowyng of the Aulters, the prayeng towardes the

And after lyke ſorte I ſpake of Canons, Decrees, and Ordinaunces of byſſhops and generall counſels.</p>
            <p>Now I do confeſſe the ſaide do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as concernyng thobſeruyng of the ſayd Traditions vnder that payne, to be falſe and Tirannicall, an vniuſt, vnlawfull, and vntrew burdein of mens conſciences, not fit to be taught, preched, or defended,</p>
            <p>Lykewyſe of the beleuynge of thinges where I dyd ſay, that there are diuerſe thynges not expreſſed in the ſcripture which we are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to beleue egally with thoſe thynges
<pb facs="tcp:5269:9"/> which arr written in Scripture, in the nomber of which I dyd co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſely &amp; indiſeretely for an example bring ſome of the afore reherſed and other many. As co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernyng many things in my booke put, and the more nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber there by me reconed and named I affirme and ſay to be falſe, and in no wyſe trew, but very daungerous and vniuſtly, onerous to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of chriſten men: and too be trew only in thoſe Doctrines which neceſſaryly may be gathered, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently doo folow too the wordes and ſentences in Scripture, ſo that in effect they may be iuſtly counted to be in ſcripture, though the very fourme of woordes be not there: Of the which in my Booke is very few, yet ſome I dyd reherſe: as <hi>Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus pueroru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Deſcenſus Chriſti ad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feros, Virginitas Marie, Trinitas perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum, Proceſſio Spiritus ſancti,</hi> and a

               <hi>AND</hi> now concernyng another booke whiche I made of the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, where the moaſt chief and principall article of our fayth, and moaſt directly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynyng too the redemption of our ſynnes and to our ſaluation is: That our ſauyor Chriſt Ieſu by his moaſt precious death and effuſion of his moaſt precious blood vpon the croſſe dyd redeme man kynde, taking away our ſynnes, pacifying the indignation of his father, and cancellyng thobligation that was agaynſt vs: In which Sacrifice
<pb facs="tcp:5269:13"/> makyng vnto his father, our ſayde Sauyoure Iheſus Chriſt as ſaynt Paule ſayth playnly to the Hebrew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es, was not a preeſt after the order of Aaron, foraſmuch as he was of another Trybe: and alſo, that preeſthod was imperfite and vnpro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fitable bringyng nothyng too per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: But our Sauyour Chriſt made his ſacrifice vpon the Croſſe parfectly, abſolutely, and with the moſt hygheſt perfection that could be, ſomuch, that after that one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and ſacrifice for ſyn made by hym but once only, nother he nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other creature ſhuld at any tyme after, make any mo oblacions for the ſame. And for as that ſaynt Paule ſayth, he was called an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall preeſt of the order of Melchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedeth, and not of Aaron.</p>
            <p>This fayth ought euery man and woman vndoubtedly to beleue and
<pb facs="tcp:5269:14"/> openly to profeſſe vpon payne of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſtyng dampnation, and alſo too dye in this profeſſyon if caſe ſhall ſo requyre: The which moaſt holſome &amp; moaſt neceſſary doctrine of our fayth I not dilygently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideryng, as many tymes too right great clerkes &amp; lerned men in much writynge in lyke mattiers it hath chaunced to ſay too far. The infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite and weakeneſſe of men beyng ſuche, that ſeldome in many words error hath eſcaped. So in my boke of the Sacrifice of the maſſe, I dyd incircumſpectly &amp; raſhly write and ſet furth too the people, that Chriſt was not a preeſt after the order of Melchiſedech, whan he offred him ſelfe vpon the Croſſe too his father for our ſynnes, but was a preeſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of Aaron. And that when Chriſt dyd offer his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy too his father after thorder of
<pb facs="tcp:5269:14"/> Melchiſedech tappeaſe his wrath, it may not be vnderſtand of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the croſſe, but of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſe that Chriſt made at his Maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in forme of bread and wyne: To the which in dede ſaynt Paules do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is contrary, both in other pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces, and in thepiſtle and Hebreos ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manifeſtly, agaynſt whom, who without doubt had the very ſpirite of God. Neither it becometh, nor I wyl not willingly teach or defend any thyng: Wherfore you ſhal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute that, good Audience, too the frailty of mans nature, and too my negligent marking, hauing at that tyme rather a reſpecte too a fantaſy that then I had in my mynde, than too the trew and infallyble doctrine of ſcripture. And moreouer in the ſame my booke, I ſayd not onely that the Sacrifice of the maſſe is the ſelfe ſame ſubſtaunce of Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:5269:15"/> but alſo the ſelfe ſame oblacion or offeryng of our ſauyoure Chriſtes very fleſh and blood which him ſelf once offrid to his father on the croſſe to appeale his wrath. And that the preeſtes do continually and daily in the maſſe offre not onely the ſelfe ſame body of Chriſt, but alſo to the ſame effecte, that Chriſt dyd offre himſelfe to his father at his Maun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy. Of the which wordes and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, if they be not very warely &amp; circumſpectly reade, and more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorably taken then the wordes as they lye, may well bere, it might be gatherd, that preeſtes herein be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall with Chriſt. Preeſtes of thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Melchiſedech, appeaſing the wrath &amp; indignation of the father of heauen, crucifying or offeryng Chriſt to the ſame effecte that Chriſt in his owne perſone dyd vpon the croſſe, which is a blaſphemy into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
<pb facs="tcp:5269:15"/> to be herd of chriſten eares. For Chriſt as ſaynt Paule ſayth, was but once offered, once gaue vp himſelfe for the redemption of our ſynnes on good friday on the croſſe, nor neuer before nor after was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for vs, but in a ſacrament and as a commemoration of the ſame.</p>
            <p>And ſo of the Maundy or Supper of our Lorde, Chriſt himſelf ſayth <hi>Hec quotieſcu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

He dyeth no more, &amp; his ſacrifice was ſo good ſo ful, ſo pleſant, ſo precious to god, that there needed no more oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to appeaſe god, nor only for the ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes paſt, but alſo for all the ſynnes to the day of Doome.</p>
            <p>There neede no more ſacrifices, no more offerers, but as hauyng a reſpect and a remembraunce of that
<pb facs="tcp:5269:16"/> moſt holy, moſt perfyte, and moſt entier Lambe, then &amp; for euer offred vp for vs. But theſe before ſayd I can not deny but ſpoken of me and written, And as I do not now lyke theym, ſo at thexample of ſaint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten and other good doctors, I am not aſhamed to retracte theym, call theim agayne, &amp; condempne theim. For when I folowed myne own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention not directed by Scripture, I began as the nature of man is to wander, and at the laſt went cleane contrary too Gods woord.</p>
            <p>Wherfore, I hertely exhort euery man as touchyng matiers of faith to founde the ſame vpon Gods cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyn, trew, and infallyble woorde: leſt by doyng the contrary, they fall into ſuperſtition, idolatry, &amp; other manyfold errers as I my ſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme, and many other (although I doo not come hyther too accuſe any
<pb facs="tcp:5269:16"/> man) yet I perceyue of late tyme haue doone. Wherfore, theſe my two bookes, the one of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the maſſe, and thother of the Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vnwritten, in thoſe poyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes before reherſed, &amp; all other wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in they be not full co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſonant to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I forſake &amp; renounce as falſe erroneous, and agaynſt the trew woord of God. Requiring the good chriſten reder whoſoeuer ſhall rede theym, to geue no further credence vnto theym then I wold my ſelfe: That is, not to take as vndoubted truth all that is therin written, but as written of a man that ſometyme falleth: to be ſo farre trew as they be conſonaunt to ſcripture, wher they be not agaynſt ſcripture, to be humane perſuaſion, which may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſo or not ſo, as the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone ſhall leade: where they be not conſonaunt to ſcripture to be erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſe
<pb facs="tcp:5269:17"/> and falſe, and that I muche lament &amp; am ſory that I wrote them in thoſe poyntes. And I deſyre e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man that hath any of the ſayd bokes, to beware of theym, and to gyue no credence to theym in all ſuche thynges in theim written, as be not conſonant to the ſcripture, as they auoyde occaſion of error, and tendre the truth of Gods word and his glory. To whom be laude, prayſe, and honor Amen.</p>
